    "For this project I created a chatbot where a user answers questions based on symptoms and the chatbot will take the inputs and diagnose the user with the specific condition based on mental health disorders. This chatbot will also give treatments, and explainations of the disease as well as connecting with a live video chat doctor. This chatbot will also connect the user with another user on the app to that has the same condition and also can play games with each other. "

All therapies (sometimes in different ways) help people change their relationship to their symptoms.

The severity of mood episodes can range from very mild to extreme, and they can happen gradually or suddenly within a timeframe of days to weeks. When discrete mood episodes happen four or more times per year, the process is called rapid cycling. Rapid cycling should not be confused with very frequent moment-to-moment changes in mood, which can sometimes occur in people with bipolar disorder or other conditions such as borderline personality disorder. Along with manic or depressive episodes, patients with bipolar disorder may have disturbances in thinking. They may also have distortions of perception and impairment in social functioning.\", \"Treatment for bipolar disorder may include the use of mood stabilizers such as lithium. Certain anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines may also be used to stabilize mood. Sometimes antidepressants are given in combination with mood stabilizers to boost the depressed mood, although antidepressants are often not as effective as some mood stabilizers or certain atypical antipsychotics for treating depression in bipolar disorder.\")\n",
